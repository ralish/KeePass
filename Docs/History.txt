  in 'Advanced'; more events / conditions / actions can be
  added later based on user requests, and can also be provided

- Native master key transformations (rounds) are now computed
  by the native KeePassLibC support library (which contains the
  new, highly optimized transformation code used by KeePass
  1.15, in two threads); on dual/multi core processors this
  results in almost triple the performance as before (by
  tripling the amount of rounds you'll get the same waiting
  time as in 2.06, but the protection against dictionary and
  guessing attack is tripled)

  the database settings dialog)
